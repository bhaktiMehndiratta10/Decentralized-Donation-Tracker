# Decentralized-Donation-Tracker

This project is a **Decentralized Donation Tracker** written in Solidity. It allows users to send donations directly to a smart contract and transparently track how much they or others have donated — without relying on any centralized middleman.

The project is structured in **three progressive levels**:

- **Level 1 – Basic:** Simple Ether donation tracker.
- **Level 2 – Intermediate:** Adds features like withdrawal by owner, events, and fallback/receive handling.
- **Level 3 – Advanced:** Full-featured version with donor leaderboard, deadline-based funding, refunds, and more.
